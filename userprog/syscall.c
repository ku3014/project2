If process pid is still alive, waits until it dies. Then, returns the status that pid passed to exit, or -1 if pid was terminated by the kernel (e.g. killed due to an exception). If pid does not refer to a child of the calling thread, or if wait has already been successfully called for the given pid, returns -1 immediately, without waiting.
You must ensure that Pintos does not terminate until the initial process exits. The supplied Pintos code tries to do this by calling process_wait() (in userprog/process.c) from main() (in threads/init.c). We suggest that you implement process_wait() according to the comment at the top of the function and then implement the wait system call in terms of process_wait().

All of a process's resources, including its struct thread, must be freed whether its parent ever waits for it or not, and regardless of whether the child exits before or after its parent.

Children are not inherited: if A has child B and B has child C, then wait(C) always returns immediately when called from A, even if B is dead.

Consider all the ways a wait can occur: nested waits (A waits for B, then B waits for C), multiple waits (A waits for B, then A waits for C), and so on.

Implementing this system call requires considerably more work than any of the rest.

Each process has an independent set of file descriptors. File descriptors are not inherited by child processes.

A later write extends the file, filling any unwritten gap with zeros. (However, in Pintos files have a fixed length until project 4 is complete,
